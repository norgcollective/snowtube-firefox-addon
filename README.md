Do You know Snowflake? The tiny little Rectangle, developed by TheTorProject, that helps people in censored countries  
to circumvent censorship. Why don't we take unnecessary parts of some WebSites to replace them with a Helping Snowflake?   

SnowTube will inject a Snowflake into Websites that are ussually left open for a long time,
for example Wikipedia, Youtube or some Online Magazines like the american New York Times or the german Spiegel.
